1. Follow DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle while coding.
2. Use function to stop writing repeating line of codes.
3. Function that takes another function as argument(callback function) is known as Higher order functions.
4. It is this ability that function can be stored, passed and returned,  they are called first class citizens.
5. If we use Array.property.function-name. This function is accessible to any array in your code.

Benefits of Using Functional Programming
1. Predictable & Easier to Debug
Pure functions always return the same output for the same input.
No hidden state, no side effects → fewer “mystery bugs.”

2. Immutability
Data isn’t changed; instead, new data structures are returned.
Helps avoid accidental mutations and race conditions in async app.

3. Reusability & Composability
Functions are small, focused, and can be composed together.
Encourages DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code.

4. Testability
Pure functions are easier to test (no side effects, no hidden dependencies).

5. Parallel & Concurrent Friendly
No shared mutable state → safer to run in parallel or async tasks.

6. Readability & Maintainability
Code often reads closer to English: “filter the list, map the results, reduce to one value.”
Easier for teams to reason about.

⚡ Summary

Functional Programming gives you:
1. ✔ Predictable behavior (pure functions)
2. ✔ Safer state handling (immutability)
3. ✔ Reusable, composable code
4. ✔ Easier testing
5. ✔ More declarative style
